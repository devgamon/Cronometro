## Project

<p align="left"> This repository was created with the sole purpose of testing my current skills with Javascript, even though it is a project with a low level of difficulty, it is one of the most "classic" ways to test learning in Javascript. In a nutshell, the project basically consists of a "chronometer" that works using pure javascript as fuel.</p>
